# ADR 0001: Monorepo Architecture

Date: 2025-01-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a scalable architecture that supports:
- Multiple applications (web, API, workers)
- Shared code and configurations
- Consistent tooling and practices
- Fast builds and tests
- Type safety across boundaries

## Decision

We will use a monorepo architecture with:
- **pnpm** for package management (fast, disk-efficient)
- **Turborepo** for build orchestration (incremental builds, remote caching)
- **TypeScript** as primary language
- **Workspace structure**:
  - `/apps/*` - deployable applications
  - `/packages/*` - shared libraries
  - `/docs/*` - documentation

## Consequences

### Positive
- Single source of truth for all code
- Atomic commits across multiple packages
- Shared tooling and configurations
- Easy refactoring across boundaries
- Consistent developer experience

### Negative
- Requires discipline in managing dependencies
- Larger repository size
- CI/CD complexity increases
- Need proper access controls

### Mitigations
- Use Turborepo for smart builds
- Implement CODEOWNERS for access control
- Use changesets for version management
- Enable remote caching for CI
