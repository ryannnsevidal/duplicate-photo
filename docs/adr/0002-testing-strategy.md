# ADR 0002: Testing Strategy

Date: 2025-01-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a comprehensive testing strategy that:
- Ensures code quality and prevents regressions
- Provides fast feedback during development
- Supports different types of tests (unit, integration, E2E)
- Works well in CI/CD pipelines
- Handles external dependencies gracefully

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered testing approach:

### Testing Framework
- **Vitest** for unit and integration tests (fast, ESM-native)
- **Testing Library** for component testing
- **Playwright** for E2E tests
- **Testcontainers** for integration tests with real databases

### Test Structure
```
Unit Tests (70%)
- Pure functions in /packages/core
- React components with mocked dependencies
- Fast, focused, numerous

Integration Tests (20%)
- API endpoints with real database
- Service integration
- Use testcontainers for isolation

E2E Tests (10%)
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-browser testing
- Run on staging environment
```

### Practices
- Test-first development (TDD)
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Tests must pass before merge
- Parallel test execution
- Test data factories for consistency

## Consequences

### Positive
- High confidence in code changes
- Fast feedback loops
- Realistic test environments
- Easy to debug failures
- Prevents regression

### Negative
- Initial setup complexity
- Slower CI builds with containers
- Resource intensive
- Learning curve for testcontainers

### Mitigations
- Cache Docker images in CI
- Use test parallelization
- Provide good documentation
- Create helper utilities
