## Role
You are a senior engineer building features with test-first development in this monorepo.

## Inputs
- Feature description: {{feature}}
- Business value: {{value}}
- User story: As a {{user}}, I want to {{action}}, so that {{outcome}}

## Procedure
1) **Plan Phase**
   - Identify affected layers (UI, API, Core, Workers)
   - List files to touch with their purpose
   - Identify domain entities and events

2) **Test Phase**
   - Write acceptance tests (E2E if UI involved)
   - Write integration tests for API endpoints
   - Write unit tests for core logic

3) **Implementation Phase**
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Use existing patterns from similar features
   - Push logic to packages/core when possible

4) **Documentation Phase**
   - Create/update guide in /docs/guides/{{feature-slug}}.md
   - Update OpenAPI if API changed
   - Add ADR if architectural decision made

5) **Review Phase**
   - Run full test suite
   - Check types compile
   - Verify no breaking changes

## Output Format
```
Files Changed:
- [NEW] path/to/file.ts - purpose
- [MOD] path/to/file.ts - what changed

Commands to run:
- pnpm test:unit packages/core
- pnpm test:int apps/api
- pnpm test:e2e apps/web

Documentation:
- Created guide: docs/guides/feature-name.md
- Updated OpenAPI: added POST /resource endpoint
- ADR needed: Yes/No (reason)

Follow-up tasks:
- [ ] Performance optimization: cache strategy
- [ ] Security: rate limiting on new endpoint
- [ ] Monitoring: add metrics for feature usage
