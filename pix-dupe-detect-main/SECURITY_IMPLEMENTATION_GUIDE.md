# Security Implementation Guide

## Phase 1 Security Fixes - COMPLETED ✅

### 1. reCAPTCHA Configuration Security ✅
- **Fixed**: Removed hardcoded reCAPTCHA test keys from components
- **Added**: Secure environment variable loading with runtime validation
- **Added**: Prevention of test key deployment to production
- **Created**: `SecureConfigScript` component for secure configuration management

**Required Action**: Configure the `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` secret in Supabase:
1. Get your reCAPTCHA site key from https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create
2. Add it as a secret in Supabase Edge Functions settings
3. The system will automatically use test keys in development and secure keys in production

### 2. Enhanced File Upload Validation ✅
- **Added**: MIME type signature verification to prevent file type spoofing
- **Added**: Malicious content scanning for common attack patterns
- **Enhanced**: Server-side validation with detailed security logging
- **Added**: File signature validation against declared MIME types
- **Added**: Comprehensive malware pattern detection

**Security Features**:
- Validates file signatures against declared MIME types
- Scans for executable file signatures (PE, ELF, Mach-O)
- Detects script injection attempts (JavaScript, PHP, VBScript)
- Blocks suspicious file extensions and content patterns
- Comprehensive security event logging

### 3. Secure Chart CSS Injection ✅
- **Fixed**: Replaced unsafe `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with sanitized CSS
- **Added**: CSS sanitization function to remove dangerous patterns
- **Added**: Color format validation (HSL/RGB/hex/CSS variables only)
- **Enhanced**: Input validation for chart configuration

**Security Improvements**:
- Removes `javascript:`, `expression()`, `@import`, and other dangerous CSS patterns
- Validates color formats before injection
- Filters out null/invalid color configurations

### 4. Enhanced Content Security Policy ✅
- **Added**: Production-ready CSP headers via `SecureConfigScript`
- **Added**: X-Frame-Options protection against clickjacking
- **Added**: X-Content-Type-Options for MIME type protection
- **Enhanced**: Runtime security header injection

## Next Steps - Phase 2 (Recommended)

### 1. Advanced Session Security
- Implement session fingerprinting
- Add device tracking and notifications
- Enhanced session validation middleware

### 2. Enhanced Input Validation
- Schema validation for all API endpoints
- Advanced XSS protection layers
- Input complexity validation

### 3. Security Monitoring
- Real-time threat detection
- Automated security responses
- Compliance reporting dashboard

## Security Configuration Checklist

### Production Deployment:
- [ ] Configure `RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` in Supabase secrets
- [ ] Verify reCAPTCHA site key is for your domain
- [ ] Test file upload validation with various file types
- [ ] Monitor security audit logs for any issues
- [ ] Verify CSP headers are properly applied in production

### Monitoring:
- Security events are logged to `security_audit_log` table
- File validation failures are tracked with detailed metadata
- IP reputation is automatically updated for malicious behavior
- Rate limiting is enforced with progressive security levels

## Security Event Types Added:
- `file_upload_blocked` - File validation failures
- `file_signature_mismatch` - MIME type spoofing attempts
- `malicious_content_detected` - Malware/script injection attempts
- `dangerous_file_upload_blocked` - Executable or script file uploads

All security fixes are backward compatible and will not break existing functionality.
